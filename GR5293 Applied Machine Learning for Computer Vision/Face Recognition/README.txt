Here's the logic of the whole code:
The steps include: segmenting faces, performing feature extraction, splitting the data for training and testing, and finally classifying the faces using a machine learning model.

We applied CascadeClassifier for face segmentation and set scaleFactor to 1.01 to ensure that the classifier methodically searches for faces, capturing those that may only exhibit slight variations in size between the different scales of the image. The minNeighbors is set to 2, because the majority of the dataset contains images with one person, and occasionally two or three. So we select the largest face detected as the largest face is the most likely to be the subject of the image.

The Random Forest classifier is chosen for its ability to handle the high-dimensional data post-PCA. It provides better generalization ability compared to simpler models like KNN.

Here are the problems and potential improvements:

1. The strategy of extracting the largest face worked well in the majority of our samples. However, in cases with multiple subjects of similar size, this approach may not correctly identify the target face. To enhance the performance, we could incorporate facial landmarks, ensuring that the most prominent face is chosen based on characteristics more specific than size alone.

2. The Random Forest model was selected for its performance. However, the model might not be capturing all the nuances of the data. To improve this, we could explore more classification algorithms, including deep learning approaches, which may offer better generalization.
